Leave Management System | Java, Hibernate, MySQL

A console-based Leave Management System developed using Java and Hibernate. The application allows employees to apply for leave, automatically marks leave requests as PENDING based on business rules, and stores employee and leave data in a MySQL database using ORM. 
The project follows layered architecture with DAO and Service layers to separate business logic and database operations.
